# Ai-basedCropdiseasedetection
i have craeted one of the machine learning model to use in the lightweight devices such as mobile based application 
for this i have used the model mobilenetv2 of the CNN model, this model is train using the dataset from the Plant village ,
through this model the user can detect any disease of plant that i have trained.
the below is given directory for using the sourcecodes for training models and u can download the dataset from the Plant Village or kaggle
